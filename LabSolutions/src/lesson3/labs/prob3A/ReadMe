Q: Does it make sense to use inheritance here? Explain
A: It make no sense.
  Reason:
    1. Only the radius attribute is available for subclass.
    2. The height attribute and the computeVolume operation inherited from super class
    	make no sense for subclass.
    3. When the height attribute of subclass are changed, the computeVolume operation of
    	subclass will change output.
